# SimplePomodoro
A simple Pomodoro timer running on the system tray. Configurable time(s) and number of sessions.

## How to use
1) Open **config.txt** with a file editor (Notepad is sufficient)
2) Change the settings to your preferences. Remember to save the file.
3) Run **SimplePomodoro.exe**. It will run on the system tray.
4) Right-click the <a href="icon.png">Simple Pomodoro icon</a>, and click "Start Session" to start a session.
<br>A notification will pop up to when your work/break/long break sessions are over.
<br>If your settings are not automatic, you can proceed to the next session by right-clicking the icon
<br>and clicking "Continue Session".
<br>
<br>**NOTE:** On default settings, **Auto Work-Session Starts** are enabled, meaning you don't have to click
<br>"Continue Session" every time you're about to start your work session, but you have to click
<br>every time your work sessions are finished. **Auto Break-Session Starts** works the same, but for break sessions.
<br>You can enable both settings for the ultimate "I'm-too-focused-to-right-click" experience.
<br>
<br>
5) You can stop an ongoing session by right-clicking the icon and clicking "Stop Session".
<br>You can also reset an ongoing session after stopping by right-clicking the icon and clicking "Reset Session".
6) Right-click the icon and click "Exit" to terminate the program.
