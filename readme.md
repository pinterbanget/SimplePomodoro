## How to use

4) Right-click the <a href="icon.png">Simple Pomodoro icon</a>, and click "Start Session" to start a session.
<br>A notification will pop up to when your work/break/long break sessions are over.
<br>If your settings are not automatic, you can proceed to the next session by right-clicking the icon
<br>and clicking "Continue Session". You can also click "Continue Session" while a session is ongoing
<br>to skip the session.
<br>**NOTE:** You can enable **Auto Work-Session Starts** and **Auto Break-Session Starts**, meaning you don't have 
<br>to click "Continue Session" every time you're about to start your work or break session.
